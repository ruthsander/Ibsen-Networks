# Ibsen-Networks

**csv**

This folder contains all the csc files complied and created during the project. These files contain information on Ibsen and his correspondents, and relevant letter data. This data is divided into two groupings, with the focus being on the people or the letters. 

The files stored there are:

	•	practice_person_info.csv
	•	practice_person_info_edited.csv
	•	final_pers_org_details.csv
	•	Person_Register_Info.csv
	•	letter_information_1844-1871.csv
	•	letter_information_1871-1879.csv
	•	letter_information_1880-1889.csv
	•	letter_information_1890-1905.csv
	•	merged_letter_info.csv
	•	Compiled_Letter_Data.csv

The final csv file for person data is Person_Register_Info.csv and the final csv file for the letter data is Compiled_Letter_Data.csv. The other files are intermediate files created during various stages of the data processing stage. Further information on the process and step will be given in the README in the folder ‚python‘. 

The data found in the columns 'GeoName_ID', 'toponymName', 'Country', 'Latitude', 'Longitude', 'Recipient_Addr_Latitude‘, 'Recipient_Addr_Longitude’ was collected for the geographical database GeoNames (http://www.geonames.org). The data was not amended  in any way.

The data found in the columns 'Wikidata_ID', 'Viaf_ID', 'NHRP_ID', and partially in 'Instance', 'Gender', 'Country_of_citizenship', 'Occupation' was collected from Wikidata (https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Main_Page)
